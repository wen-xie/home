Against the background of China's successful economic development, Northeast China – the former socialist heartland – has become the epitome of the Chinese "rust belt." While China boasted a miraculous economic growth rate, Northeast China did not grow as fast as other regions. It has even shown signs of economic decline. The massive factory closures of the late 1990s, and the later difficulties in economic revitalization, have earned the region the nickname "the Chinese rust belt." External investors are reluctant to invest in the region, thus the popular saying has emerged "investment should not cross Shanhaiguan," meaning it should not enter the region.&nbsp;</p><p>I raise the puzzle: (1) why did Northeast China not experience a successful market transformation like other regions in China, but instead witnessed stagnant economic performance and the formation of a conservative political and economic ethos? (2) why and how did market reform translate the past communist economic ethos in the former socialist industrial heartland into the current culture in the Chinese "rust belt"? To disentangle this process, I consulted governmental and factory archives and local newspapers, collected regional socioeconomic statistics, and conducted over 100 life history interviews with former socialist workers, as well as informant interviews with local officials and scholars.&nbsp;</p><p>My dissertation puts forward a generational encoding perspective to understand Northeast China's transformation. A quick historical and demographic examination of the region's generational constellation reveals that there are three ideal-typical generations – New China Generation (old, born 1920-1939), Maoist Generation (middle, born 1950-1969), Post-reform Generation (young, born 1980-1994). Due to the economic history of the region, the middle Maoist Generation is part of a baby boom. Their particular experiences in the Mao era had a homogenizing effect on this cohort which was deprived of institutionalized education. In Northeast China, the Maoist Generation (born 1950-1969) is a sizable component of the local generational constellation. When market reform transpired, this generation started working and became young adults. However, rather than becoming successful market actors, this generation's particular life experiences led to fatalism, self-defeat, and retreat from the market. Its experiences reshaped the economic culture and demographic structure, impacted the region's growth potential, and have long-standing consequences on the region's market development.&nbsp;</p><p>My dissertation makes several empirical and theoretical contributions. First, emphasizing the unique path of capitalist development in Northeast China, my work expands the parameters of scholarship in studies of China’s political economy. It proposes a more historical, processual, and geographically-attuned mode of sociological inquiry as well as an approach to studying market transformation that is deeply rooted in the social milieu and human lives. Second, my dissertation introduces generation into studies of capitalist transformation and conceptualize generation as a socio-historical structure. The dissertation suggested a novel way to bridge life course, demography, historical sociology, and development. The encoding perspective provides a direction to examine broader social change in combination with demographic and biographical data.</p></div>
